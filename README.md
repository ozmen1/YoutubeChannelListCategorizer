# YoutubeChannelListCategorizer

Why?

youtube's algorithm does not promise you that when you follow a channel, you will see all of its videos on your dahsboard. with this tool, you can create an rss feed list by categorizing your channel list and follow it without missing any content. rss links are very easy to create, I obviously did not include it in the project.
